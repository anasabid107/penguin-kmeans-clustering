# Penguin K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to group penguins based on physical
measurements when species labels are not available.

## Dataset
The dataset contains penguin measurements collected in Antarctica.
Species labels are missing, and unsupervised learning is used.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Dummy variable creation
- Feature scaling
- Elbow method to find optimal clusters
- K-Means clustering
- Cluster-wise statistical analysis

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Outcome
The clustering results show clear separation between penguin groups,
which likely correspond to different species.
